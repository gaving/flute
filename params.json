Want to *hear* when something's working?\r\n\r\nMeet *flute*.\r\n\r\n## Screencast\r\n\r\n[Here's a screencast.](https://vimeo.com/39440084)\r\n\r\n## Install\r\n\r\n    npm install flute -g\r\n\r\n    ♬♩ Musical pipeline ♬♩\r\n    Usage: flute [args]\r\n\r\n    Options:\r\n      -t, --tracks  use tracks from config ~/.flute.yml\r\n\r\n## Configure\r\n\r\nFlute passed with no arguments plays a rubbish flute sound. However, this can\r\neasily be changed to a list of tracks by specifying them in a config file with\r\nthe following steps:-\r\n\r\n- Create a ~/.flute.yml file\r\n- Create a file with the absolute path of your files (tracks: at the top is important):-\r\n\r\n    tracks: \r\n      - /Volumes/WD/Music/iTunes/iTunes Music/Music/Lana Del Rey/Born to Die/06 National Anthem.m4a\r\n      - /Volumes/WD/Music/iTunes/iTunes Music/Music/Compilations/Final Fantasy  VII/1-07 Hurry!.m4a\r\n      - /Volumes/WD/Music/iTunes/iTunes Music/Music/Compilations/Final Fantasy  VII/4-08 Hurry Faster!.m4a\r\n\r\nPass the -t argument to flute and it will pick one of these at random.\r\n\r\n## Examples\r\n\r\nInject flute into your pipeline wherever:-\r\n\r\n     pv -L 5k ~/Desktop/eI3s-dvZysU.flv | flute > /dev/null\r\n\r\n     youtube-dl http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azOWjmfUqVw -o - | flute > harris.flv\r\n\r\n     dd if=/dev/urandom | pv -L 10M | flute -t > k\r\n\r\n## Note\r\n\r\nFlute has only been tested on OSX.\r\n","tagline":"Add some music to your pipelines","google":"UA-30540568-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
